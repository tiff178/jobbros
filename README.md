# IrvineHacks 2025 - JobBros

*From Bros to Pros!*

This project aims to solve the issue of tracking your job applications and their statuses on your own, whether that be Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel. Our web application integrated the application tracker within the same platform as the job search to make it more convenient for users. The website can also generate resumes for users to help them reduce time in formatting their resume, as well as they can look into resources (e.g. resume tips, interview preparation, etc.)
