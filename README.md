# IrvineHacks 2025 - JobBros

This project aims to solve the issue of tracking your job applications and their statuses on your own, whether that be Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel. Our web application integrated the application tracker within the same platform as the job search to make it more convenient for users. Not only do we aim to focus on users, but we also want to make it accessible for recruiters to post their jobs and updates on their end.
